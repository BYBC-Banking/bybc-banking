          content: "Technical analysis is the study of price charts, trading volumes, and market behavior to predict future stock movements. This methodology relies on the principle that historical price patterns tend to repeat due to consistent human psychology in trading.\n\n**Core Principles of Technical Analysis:**\n\n**1. Price Discounts Everything:**\n- All available information is reflected in current stock price\n- News, earnings, and market sentiment are already factored in\n- Focus on price action rather than external factors\n\n**2. Prices Move in Trends:**\n- Uptrends: Series of higher highs and higher lows\n- Downtrends: Series of lower highs and lower lows\n- Sideways trends: Price moves within a range\n\n**3. History Repeats:**\n- Human emotions drive similar patterns\n- Fear and greed create predictable behaviors\n- Past patterns provide insights into future movements\n\n**Key Technical Indicators:**\n\n**Moving Averages:**\n- Simple Moving Average (SMA): Average price over specific periods\n- Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Gives more weight to recent prices\n- Common periods: 20, 50, 100, 200 days\n- Crossovers signal potential trend changes\n\n**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**\n- Measures momentum on scale of 0-100\n- Above 70: Potentially overbought (sell signal)\n- Below 30: Potentially oversold (buy signal)\n- Divergence with price indicates potential reversal\n\n**MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):**\n- Shows relationship between two moving averages\n- MACD line: 12-day EMA minus 26-day EMA\n- Signal line: 9-day EMA of MACD line\n- Histogram: Difference between MACD and signal lines\n- Crossovers indicate momentum changes\n\n**Bollinger Bands:**\n- Middle band: 20-day SMA\n- Upper/lower bands: 2 standard deviations from middle\n- Price touching upper band: Potentially overbought\n- Price touching lower band: Potentially oversold\n- Band squeeze indicates low volatility before major moves\n\n**Volume Indicators:**\n- On-Balance Volume (OBV): Confirms price trends\n- Volume Rate of Change: Measures volume momentum\n- High volume confirms price movements\n- Low volume suggests weak trends\n\n**Support and Resistance:**\n\n**Support Levels:**\n- Price levels where buying interest emerges\n- Previous lows often become support\n- Psychological price levels (round numbers)\n- Moving averages can act as dynamic support\n\n**Resistance Levels:**\n- Price levels where selling pressure increases\n- Previous highs often become resistance\n- High-volume price areas create resistance\n- Breaking resistance often leads to continued upward movement\n\n**Chart Patterns:**\n\n**Reversal Patterns:**\n- Head and Shoulders: Bearish reversal pattern\n- Inverse Head and Shoulders: Bullish reversal\n- Double Top/Bottom: Reversal patterns at extremes\n- Triple Top/Bottom: Strong reversal signals\n\n**Continuation Patterns:**\n- Triangles: Ascending, descending, symmetrical\n- Flags and Pennants: Brief consolidations in trends\n- Rectangles: Horizontal consolidation patterns\n- Wedges: Rising and falling wedge patterns\n\n**Candlestick Patterns:**\n\n**Single Candlestick Patterns:**\n- Doji: Indecision in the market\n- Hammer: Potential bullish reversal\n- Shooting Star: Potential bearish reversal\n- Spinning Top: Market uncertainty\n\n**Multiple Candlestick Patterns:**\n- Engulfing Patterns: Strong directional signals\n- Harami: Potential trend reversal\n- Morning/Evening Star: Three-candle reversal patterns\n- Three White Soldiers/Black Crows: Strong continuation signals\n\n**Timeframe Analysis:**\n- Daily charts: Swing trading and position trading\n- 4-hour charts: Short-term trend analysis\n- 1-hour charts: Intraday trading decisions\n- 15-minute charts: Scalping and quick trades\n\n**Risk Management in Technical Analysis:**\n- Set stop-losses below support levels\n- Use position sizing based on risk tolerance\n- Confirm signals with multiple indicators\n- Avoid overreliance on single indicators\n\nTechnical analysis provides powerful tools for timing market entries and exits, but should be combined with fundamental analysis for comprehensive investment decisions."
