          content: "The foreign exchange market operates through currency pairs, representing the relative value between two currencies. Understanding major currency pairs is crucial for successful forex trading.\n\n**The Seven Major Currency Pairs:**\n\n1. **EUR/USD (Euro/US Dollar)** - The world's most traded pair, accounting for ~24% of daily forex volume. Known as 'Fiber' among traders.\n\n2. **GBP/USD (British Pound/US Dollar)** - Called 'Cable', represents ~9% of daily volume. Highly volatile due to Brexit impacts and UK economic policies.\n\n3. **USD/JPY (US Dollar/Japanese Yen)** - Known as 'Gopher', represents ~13% of volume. Popular for carry trades due to Japan's historically low interest rates.\n\n4. **USD/CHF (US Dollar/Swiss Franc)** - Called 'Swissy', represents ~4% of volume. Considered a safe-haven currency during market uncertainty.\n\n5. **AUD/USD (Australian Dollar/US Dollar)** - Known as 'Aussie', heavily influenced by commodity prices, especially gold and iron ore.\n\n6. **USD/CAD (US Dollar/Canadian Dollar)** - Called 'Loonie', strongly correlated with oil prices due to Canada's oil exports.\n\n7. **NZD/USD (New Zealand Dollar/US Dollar)** - Known as 'Kiwi', influenced by agricultural commodity prices and dairy exports.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n**Base vs Quote Currency:**\n- Base currency (first): The currency being bought or sold\n- Quote currency (second): The currency used to price the base currency\n- Price shows how much quote currency is needed to buy one unit of base currency\n\n**Spread and Liquidity:**\nMajor pairs typically offer:\n- Tightest spreads (0.1-3 pips)\n- Highest liquidity (easiest to buy/sell)\n- Most predictable price movements\n- Lowest trading costs\n\n**Trading Sessions:**\n- London Session (8 AM - 5 PM GMT): Highest volume for EUR/GBP pairs\n- New York Session (1 PM - 10 PM GMT): Peak activity for USD pairs\n- Tokyo Session (12 AM - 9 AM GMT): Best for JPY pairs\n\n**Factors Affecting Major Pairs:**\n- Central bank interest rate decisions\n- Economic data releases (GDP, inflation, employment)\n- Political events and elections\n- Trade relationships between countries\n- Market sentiment and risk appetite\n\nMastering major currency pairs provides the foundation for understanding global forex markets and developing effective trading strategies."
